People are requesting that we create definitions for various L2s and sidechains. We'll use this document as a community resource to label, define, and document the various types of scaling protocols that are aiming to support Bitcoin scaling. This document will be a part of a glossary we are preparing for the Bitcoin Layers site.

- Layer 2 (a): A protocol that supports unilateral and ensures network operators cannot commit fraud
- Layer 2 (b): A protocol that supports unilateral exit
- Layer 2 (c): A protocol where anyone can ensure the honesty of a two-way peg and corresponding withdrawals
- Sidechain: An alternative consensus protocol that is built to scale Bitcoin and/or add functionality to BTC the asset
- Stakechain: A sidechain protocol that uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, leveraging BTC the asset, to secure the chain
- Merge-mined Sidechain: A sidechain protocol that has a separate security budget, but sees Bitcoin miners opt-in to participate in securing the sidechain. Merged mining enables Bitcoin miners to secure sidechains, and earn additional revenue, via the same mining infrastructure.
- Anchored Sidechain: 
- Spiderchain: A sidechain protocol that leverages a variety of rotating multi-sigs to secure the BTC that is deposited into the sidechain. 
- Appchain: A sidechain protocol that inherits no security from Bitcoin, but is purpose-built to support applications that add functionality to BTC and Bitcoin assets.
- Rollup: A blockchain that posts its latest state root, and enough transaction data to reconstruct its state from genesis, to Bitcoin
- Sovereign rollup: A rollup that does not have a validating bridge (a.k.a enshrined two-way peg) with Bitcoin
- Validity rollup: A rollup where a prover submits a validity proof to a verifier contract on the L1 proving that the state transition was executed correctly
- Optimistic rollup: A rollup where challengers can submit a fault proof to challenge malicious state transitions
- Bitvium Rollup: A rollup with where the sequencer executes state transitions and has prover submit a validity proof to a group of verifiers on the L1 optimistically prove the state transition was executed correctly
- Validium: A blockchain that uses an offchain system for data availability and has a prover submits a validity proof to a verifier contract on the L1 proving that the state transition was executed correctly
- Optimium: A blockchain that uses an offchain system for data availability and has challengers can submit a fault proof to challenge malicious state transitions
- Bitvimium: A blockchain that uses an offchain system for data availability and has a prover submit a validity proof to a group of verifiers on the L1 optimistically prove the state transition was executed correctly
