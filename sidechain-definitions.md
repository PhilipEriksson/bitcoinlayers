People are requesting that we create definitions for various L2s and sidechains. We'll use this document as a community resource to label, define, and document the various types of scaling protocols that are aiming to support Bitcoin scaling. This document will be a part of a glossary we are preparing for the Bitcoin Layers site.

- Layer 2 (a): A protocol that supports unilateral and ensures network operators cannot commit fraud
- Layer 2 (b): A protocol that supports unilateral exit
- Layer 2 (c): A protocol where anyone can ensure the honesty of a two-way peg and corresponding withdrawals
- Sidechain:
- Appchain:
- Payment channel:
- State channel:
- Rollup: A blockchain that posts its latest state root, and enough transaction data to reconstruct its state from genesis, to Bitcoin
- Sovereign rollup: A rollup that does not have a validating bridge (a.k.a enshrined two-way peg) with Bitcoin
- Validity rollup: A rollup where a prover submit a validity proof to a verifier contract on the L1 proving that the state transition was executed correctly
- Optimistic rollup: A rollup where challengers can submit a fault proof to challenge malicious state transitions
- Bit-rollup: A rollup with where the sequencer executes state transitions a has prover submit a validity proof to a group of verifiers on the L1 optimistically prove the state transition was executed correctly
- Validium: A blockchain that uses an offchain system for data availability and has a prover submits a validity proof to a verifier contract on the L1 proving that the state transition was executed correctly
- Optimium: A blockchain that uses an offchain system for data availability and has challengers can submit a fault proof to challenge malicious state transitions
- Bitvimium: A blockchain that uses an offchain system for data availability and has a prover submit a validity proof to a group of verifiers on the L1 optimistically prove the state transition was executed correctly
- Client-side validation:
- zkCSV:
- Statechain:
- Spacechain:
- Ecash:
- Fedimint:
- Stakechain:
- Merge-mined Sidechain:
